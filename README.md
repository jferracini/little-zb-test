![Project test for](https://github.com/jferracini/little-zb-test/blob/master/src/assets/lts-logo-dark.png "Little Zebra Foundation")

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5.

## First steps
 
Clone project `git clone https://github.com/jferracini/little-zb-test`

and

Open Terminal and Run `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` (preferably in Google Chrome). 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### I was not worried about performing the unit test as it would take a bit of refactory.
